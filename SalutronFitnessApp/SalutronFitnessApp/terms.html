		<h4>What Data Does LifeTrak Collect?</h4>
		
		<h4>When You Activate a LifeTrak device</h4>
		<p align="justify">
		When activating a LifeTrak device, you will be asked to download the LifeTrak App or install Software and enter information about yourself, such as height,
weight and gender. We use this information to determine your personalized fitness stats&#45; for example, calories burned and distance traveled. Depending
upon the specific Device you use, it can collect the number of steps you take, your weight, measure your sleep quality and transmit this data to LifeTrak.
		</p>
		
		<h4>When You Create a LifeTrak Account</h4>
		<p align="justify">
		If you want to access data collected by your Device from the LifeTrak App, you must create a LifeTrak account. When you create a LifeTrak account, we ask for some personal information, including your email address.
		</p>
		
		<!--
		<h4>When You Add Information to Your Account</h4>
		<p align="justify">
		You can customize your LifeTrak experience by adding other types of information to your account, such as by adding a food log or by setting an alarm,
personalizing your profile with photos, participating in discussion boards, or sending messages to your LifeTrak friends. Whenever you add this type of data,
we collect it and store it with your other account information.

shipping address so we can process your order through our fulfillment partner. We do not, however, view or store your credit card information. This is
handled by our third-party payment processor. If you are not logged into your account at the time of purchase, we do not associate that data with your
